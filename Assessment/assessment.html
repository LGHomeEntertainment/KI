        The beginnings of Yoga were developed by the Indus-Sarasvati
        civilization in Northern India over 5,000 years ago. While there are
        more than 100 different types, or schools, of yoga, most sessions
        typically include breathing exercises, meditation, and assuming postures
        (sometimes called asana or poses) that stretch and flex various muscle
        groups.
